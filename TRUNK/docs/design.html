        <h1>Java openEHR Kernel - Design Document</h1>
        <h2>0.Purpose</h2>
        <p>This document describes the design choices made in our Java implementation of the openEHR
        kernel. The openEHR specification is made on abstract level and agnostic about
        implementation technologies, therefore a number of design choices have been made for the
        work to be carried out. It also describes briefly the design for archetype based
        object creation, which is not yet covered by openEHR specification.

        <h2>1.Overview</h2>
        <p>This software is a Java implementation of the openEHR kernel, which consists of Reference Model
        (EHR, EHR Extract, Demographic, Common, Data Structures, Data Types and Support) and the Archetype
        Object Model. Besides, there is support for archetype based object creation and validation
        implemented in Archetype Object Model classes.
        </p>

        <h2>2.Design Goals</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Faithful to the specification
           <li>Java look-and-feel
           <li>Application agnostic
        </ul>

        <p>No doubt, being faithful to the specification is what implementation all about, otherwise there is
        no need for a specification. It all comes down to implement every packages, classes, methods,
        attributes and invariants.
        </p>

        <p>Since this is a Java implementation, it should look like Java. The code and API should let Java
        programmers feel familiar to work with. It leads to use Java naming convention for different entities.
        See below for conversion rules between names in the openEHR specification and the Java code. It is
        also desired to use well known APIs, including both from the official Java APIs and other well known APIs,
        e.g. Jarkata Commons. Java idioms and patterns are used when appropriate.
        </p>

        <p>It is intended to make this implementation independent to the environment where it is deployed.
        It should happily run within a command line tool with no graphic user interface, or within a full blown desktop
        application or as a component on the server side.
        </p>

        <h2>3.Java Platform</h2>
        <p>The Java platform targeted here is jdk1.5 mainly because of newly added support of generic types,
        which makes it much easier to implement the openEHR specification than without generics support.
        Annotations from jdk1.5 is also used to pass constructor parameters information into object creation
        process.
        </p>


        <h2>4.Assumed Types</h2>
        <p>The list of assumed types are quoted from openEHR Support Information Model document. The mapping
        to Java types is listed below:

        <h2>5.Naming</h2>
        <p>In general, naming of packages, classes, methods and attributes should follow
        the Java Naming Convention. It should be noticed that the conversion between
        names in the openEHR specification and names in the Java implementation can be automated.
        </p>

        <h3>5.1.Package Names</h3>
        <p>package names has "org.openehr." prefixed and "_" removed, e.g. rm.ehr_extract ->
        org.openehr.rm.ehrextract
        </p>

        <h3>5.2.Class Names</h3>
        <p>The first letter of each word in class name becomes upper cased and the rest of letters
        lower cased, and all "_" are removed, e.g. DV_CODED_TEXT -> DvCodedText
        </p>

        <h3>5.3.Attribute Names</h3>
        <p>Same as class names except the very first letter of the name is in lower case,
        e.g. calendar_alignment -> calendarAlignment
        </p>

        <h3>5.4.Method Names</h3>
        <p>Same as attribute names, e.g. is_strictly_comparable_to() -> isStrictlyComparableTo()
        </p>

        <h3>5.5.Accessors</h3>
        <p>For attributes (fields) that are declared by the specification are implemented as private fields
        and public accessors (getters) are provided.
        </p>

        <h2>6.Value Objects</h2>
        <p>Most of the Datatypes classes and classes from some other packages are essentially Value Objects,
        whose purpose is to
        pass values around. The equality of Value Object is not based on the identity but instead
        its values. Both equals() and hashCode() for all Value Objects are overridden to use the values
        of all relevant fields to obey general contract of both methods.

        <h2>7.Immutable Objects</h2>
        <p>Most of classes in the reference model are good candidates of immutable object. Immutable
        objects are easier to design and implement than mutable objects. They are also easier to use
        and much safer.
        </p>

        <h2>8.Archetype Based Object Creation</h2>
        <p><strong>warning: this part of work is not specified by openEHR</strong></p>
        <p>The logic for archetype based object creation mainly consists of following two parts:
        reference model class instantiation and archetype object tree traverse.
        </p>
        <h3>8.1.Reference Model Class Instantiation</h3>
        <p>This part of the logic is responsible for creating instance of the reference model classes. To achieve
        great flexibility, it is desired not to have specific construction knowledge, e.g. parameter
        validation information, for any reference model classes. The implementation is done in
        Class RMObjectBuilder in package org.openehr.rm.util together with annotations of constructor
        parameters in all concrete reference model classes. The interface of the build method takes the name
        of the class, of which an instance will be created and a collection of named values.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2.Archetype Object Tree Traverse</h3>
        <p>To be able to create upper level reference model classes instances like OBSERVATION and PERSON, lower level
        classes instances from data_structure and data_types have to be created in advance. Since an archetype
        instance is a constraint of an object model and dictates which specific object instance can be used
        for given object node, it makes sense to traverse the archetype model object tree to instantiate the
        reference model instance at the same time. So essentially the object creation process is traversing
        the archetype model object tree recursively and calling the RMObjectBuilder with data gathered along
        the way at each object node.
        </p>

        <h3>8.3.Constructor Annotations</h3>
        <p>Since the Java reflection API dose not support getting parameter names from methods or
        constructors, annotations is used to pass parameter names, optionalities information into object
        creation process. It is
        also used to indicate if the parameter is expected as input from the user or if it is supplied
        by the system at runtime.
        </p>

        <h3>8.4.Leaf Node Object Creation</h3>
        <p>In practice, it is preferred to have all error messages at once than one for each time. And most
        of the time, the input from the user is used for construction of leaf object node most likely data_types
        classes instance. Also sometimes it is possible to create objects by processing constraints from
        C_PRIMITIVE_OBJECT or C_DOMAIN_TYPE if the value has already been chosen there. Therefore, it
        is possible to go through all leaf object node to see if the input is required from the user or not, and
        if the input from the user has violated any leaf constraints before the traverse of object tree starts.
        </p>

        <h3>8.5.Input Interface</h3>
        <p>The input for object creation is assumedly divided into two categories, user input and system input.
        The system
        input must be supplied by the runtime system, which is normally achieved by direct programming. In case of
        user input, if the input from the user is required (not enough with the information from the constraint),
        a unique input identification is assigned to the node and will be used for binding the input value submitted
        from the user. All user input are regarded as string value and parsed into to the right type in the process.
        </p>

        <h3>8.6.Error Reporting</h3>
        <p>Errors occurring during the object creation are reported at two stages. At the first stage, all leaf
        node constraints are evaluated against the input. If there are any errors, they are all reported at
        the same time. After that, the object traverse starts and if any error occurs, the
        creation process will halt and report the error with the node path. Currently, there are a number of
        error types can be reported and the major ones are as following:
            <ol>
                <li>MISSING, meaning a required input is missing from the user input
                <li>BAD_VALUE, meaning an input is invalid according to the constraint
                <li>BAD_FORMAT, meaning an input has wrong format
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>8.7.To Do</h3>
        <p>This work is in progress, the list below are the missing features that we are aware of and will
        try to implement in the future.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>archetype chaining
            <li>archetype internal reference
            <li>dynamically adding children into C_MULTIPLE_ATTRIBUTE
        </ul>

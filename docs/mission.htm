		<h2>Purpose</h2> The purpose of this document is to state the missions of the Java
		Reference Implementation Project for people to understand what the Java project is
		aiming for and what it can provide. It is intended to be on an abstract level and the
		detailed description of the technical development of the Java project will be
		provided by the <a href="roadmap.htm">Road Map</a> document.
		<br/>
		
		<h2>Missions</h2>
		
		<h4>Validate design specifications</h4> Validate published design
		specifications through implementation activities and provide concrete feedbacks
		that will hopefully lead to improvement of the specifications.
		
		<h4>Provide a reference Java implementation</h4> Create an implementation in Java
		that is both faithful to the design specifications and technically sound thus
		provide educational purpose towards prospective openEHR developers.
		
		<h4>Explore new design ideas</h4> Explore innovative design ideas and validate them
		through implementations which will later be abstracted as new design specifications.
		
		<h4>Provide reusable software components</h4> Provide common code base grouped as
		coherent, reusable software components as building blocks for full-fledged EHR
		systems.

			use = <"Use to record the measured characteristics related to the rate and rhythm of the heart, including a simple statement of presence of heart rate.  These are not recorded by direct observation of the heart itself but inferenced from alternative sources including the auscultation of the apex beat or an electrocardiograph reflecting the electrical activity of the heart.
Heart rate and rhythm (or it's specialisation, Pulse) are commonly recorded as one component of Vital signs - comprising Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temperature, and Oximetry. There are additional specific archetypes for each of these concepts.

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record conclusions about the measured heart rate and rhythm.  Statements such as the patient is in Atrial Fibrillation, or is tachycardic, should be recorded in other specific and related EVALUATION archetypes.
Not to be used to record the mechanical heart rate, rhythm and related characteristics - this is recorded using the specialisation of this archetype OBSERVATION.heart_rate-pulse.
Not to be used to record other details of the broader cardiovascular examination or assessment.  Other specific archetypes will be used to record characteristics such as apex beat, murmurs, auscultatory findings etc.  
Concepts such as Maximal or Target Heart Rate should be recorded in separate archetypes specifically related to exercise assessment.">
